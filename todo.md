- Render client player over text (others are fine)
- Fix spaces in input box (can't make)

1. Either decide to create a login screen where you choose a name and team OR have it on screen at all times. I'm leaning towards keeping on screen at all times.
2. Something to either start the game or determine when a game starts. Thinking about a button on client itself (probably bad idea) or put in the /settings.html screen. 
3. Score
4. Spymaster Properties
5. Game logic - spymaster sets amount of words, all players on team must lock in word, if they guess other teams word, neutral word, or assasin word. 
6. Players choose avatars
7. Players choose names
8. Players choose teams
9. teams choose spymaster for that game
10. spymaster gets full map - in the actual game does the spymaster know which word is the assassin word or only know the neutral words?
